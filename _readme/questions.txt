√ How shall we handle the absolute server paths in the advanced-cache.php file. They currently reference the production server. 

	IGNORE FOR NOW.

√ On localdev, in the Groups Directory, in e-mail subscription, the subscription options (All, Weekly, Daily) are not being hidden correctly. Javascript problem? 

	IGNORE FOR NOW.

√ On http://mainelearning.net/sites/, where are the site avatar/blavatars coming from? They seem to show the Gravatar of the e-mail address associated with them. How to change them? 

	FOR CUSTOM AVATAR:  https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/192 ALSO, CHECK FOR UPDATE TO FUNCTIONS.PHP
	
	FOR GROUP AVATAR: https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/1.5.4/bp-core/bp-core-avatars.php#L297
	
	ALSO CAN HIDE IT WITH CSS.

Customise columns on the administration screens for post(types), pages, media, comments, links and users with an easy to use drag-and-drop interface.

== Description ==

Completely customise the columns on the administration screens with a nice drag and drop interface.

By default, WordPress only shows a few built-in columns. This plugin will give you many additional columns. You will have full control over all columns for pages, posts, posttypes, media, links, comments and users.

Add or remove columns, change their label, change their width and reorder them.

= Post Types Columns  =

The following custom columns are added:

* Featured Image
* Excerpt
* Post Attachments
* Page Order
* Page Templates
* Post Formats
* Taxonomies
* ID
* Slug
* Sticky
* Word count
* Roles
* Status
* Number of Attachments
* Last Modified
* Comment count
* Before More Tag Content
* Custom Fields

= User Columns =

You can also change the User Columns. The following user columns are added:

* User ID
* First name
* Last name
* Url
* Register date
* Biographical Info ( description )
* Number of Posts Types
* User Custom Fields

Some of the user custom fields that are included: user level, capabilities, admin color, nickname... many more.

= Media Columns =

Customise the Media Library Columns. The following media columns are added:

* Media ID
* File name
* Height
* Width
* Dimensions ( width x height )
* EXIF and IPTC image data
* Description, Caption and Alternate tekst
* Mime-Type
* Media Custom Fields
* Filesize

= Comment Columns =

A lot more comment colums are added, here are a few examples:

* Avatar
* Author IP
* Agent
* ID
* Comment excerpt
* Comment Meta data

= Link Columns =

A few examples of added Link columns:

* ID
* Target
* Description
* Notes
* Owner

= Custom Fields =

With the custom field column you can display any custom field values. It can show its default value but also handle it as an image or icon. Thsese types are added:

* Image thumbnails
* Icons for Media Library items
* Excerpt
* Multiple Values
* Numeric value ( this also works for sorting by meta_value_num )
* Post Titles
* Usernames
* Checkmark Image ( for true or false values )

= Sortable Custom Columns for all Screens =

All of the new columns will have support for sorting with the <a href="http://www.codepress.nl/plugins/codepress-admin-columns/sortorder-addon/">sorting addon</a>.

By default WordPress let's you only sort by Title, Date, Comments and Author. This will make you be able to <strong>sort by ALL columns of ANY type</strong>. (columns that are added by other plugins are not supported)

= Third party plugin support =

It will work nice with other plugins and support their additional custom columns. A few examples of plugins that are supported: WordPress SEO by Yoast (Robots Meta), Post Admin Shortcuts (Pin), WP Show IDs (ID) and User Access Manager (Access), Co-Authors Plus and Advanced Custom Fields.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have an idea for a great way to improve this plugin =

Great! I'd love to hear from you.
Leave your feedback at http://www.codepress.nl/plugins/codepress-admin-columns/feedback.

= How can I change the thumbnail size of images? =

You can use the build in filter to set your own thumbnail size. Just add this piece of code to your
theme's  functions.php.

To set a custom size use, for example 194 width by 63 height pixels:

`
<?php

// edit here: fill in your thumbnail height and width
$my_height = 63;
$my_width  = 194;
// stop editing

add_image_size( 'admin-columns', $my_width, $my_height, true );
add_filter('cpac_thumbnail_size', 'cb_cpac_thumbnail_size' );
function cb_cpac_thumbnail_size() {
	return 'admin-columns';
};
?>
`

**my columns thumbnails still have the wrong size**

If you want your already uploaded images to display the newly added size you will need to regenerate the thumbnail for them. Use this plugin to generate the newly added sized thumbnails: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/.

= How can I enable the use of Hidden Custom Fields? =

I am currently working on settings page where you can enable this feature. In the meanwhile you can enable this by adding
this piece of code to your theme's functions.php:

`
<?php
add_filter('cpac_use_hidden_custom_fields', '__return_true'); // enables the use hidden custom fields
?>
`

Now you can select your HIDDEN custom fields in de dropdown menu under "Custom Field:".

= How can I add the dropdown menu for taxonomy filtering? =

This will also be included in the upcoming settings page, in the meanwhile you can enable this by adding
this piece of code to your theme's functions.php:

`
<?php
add_filter( 'cpac-remove-filtering-columns', '__return_false' ); // add dropdown taxonomy filtering to the overview pages
?>
`

= How can I display a custom value in the Custom Fields Column? =

With this filter 'cpac_get_column_value_custom_field' you can control what the value will be for any Custom Field Column.

Filter explained:

* **$value** is the original value which would otherwise be displayed
* **$internal_field_key** is only used internally to store the column
* **$custom_field** is the name of your custom field
* **$type** will return either the posttype or if it is any other type it will return wp-comments, wp-links, wp-users, wp-media.
* **$object_id** will return the ID of the object.

For example if you have a custom posttype 'Demo' with a custom_field that is called 'city' and the result would be an integer '33'. You can change that integer '33' to Amsterdam.

`
<?php
function my_custom_field_value( $value, $internal_field_key, $custom_field, $type, $object_id )
{
	$my_post_type  = 'demo';
	$my_field_name = 'city';

	// make sure we have the correct posttype and fieldname
	if ( $my_post_type == $type && $my_field_name == $custom_field ) {

		if ( '33' == $value )
			$value = 'Amsterdam';

		elseif ( '34' == $value )
			$value = 'New York';
	}
	return $value;
}
add_filter( 'cpac_get_column_value_custom_field', 'my_custom_field_value', 10, 5 );
?>

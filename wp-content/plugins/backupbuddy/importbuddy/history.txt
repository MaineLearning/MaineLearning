	ImportBuddy BETA: 
		General UI cleanup and polishing.
		Added Server Info. page's Server Configuration section within new 'Server Information' button on Step 1.
		Added ability to upload backups from local computer to server (only if importbuddy password is set; for security).
		Added more Advanced Configuration options for fallback unzip modes.
		Added more detailed status logging to each step in a textarea.
		Re-arranged and reduced step count for streamlining imports.
		When 'wipe database' option is selected the mysql test now reports warnings and notes it will wipe if it finds an existing database rather than errors.
		Rather than ALL rows of ALL databases having URLs and paths 'migrated', known tables/rows where no serialized data should ever show up are skipped for increate migration performance. All unknown tables/rows are scanned and updated if needed.
		Now also deleting the import directory on cleanup step.
		Broke out all importbuddy functionality into separate files in the importbuddy directory. This directory and contents are 'extracted' from importbuddy.php if they do not exist.
		Broke out database migration functions into a new class for easier updating to handle new databases and scenarios.
		Now using ZipBuddy class for full zip compatibility fallbacks including ZipArchive & PCLZip. Issues #10, #36.
		PCLZip no longer throws undefined constant notices. Issue #14.
		No longer re-enabled commented out WP_SITEURL & WP_HOME instances in wp-config.php. Issue #52.
		Better testing / handling of serialized data. Issue #62, #29.
		Updated importbuddy to use BackupBuddy's greedy script limits funtionality. Issue #69.
		Improved ImportBuddy error messages. Issue #38.
		Better parsing of configurations in wp-config.php. Issue #33.

== Developers: How to Test ==

* 1) Create a new term by selecting Editorial Metadata from the Edit Flow settings
* 2) Edit an existing term (slug, description, etc.)
* 3) Create a post and assign metadata to it
* 4) Look at the list of terms again - the count should go up!
* 5) Play with adding more metadata to a post
* 6) Clear the metadata for a single term in a post and watch the count go down!
* 6) Delete a term and note the metadata disappears from posts
* 7) Re-add the term (same slug) and the metadata returns!

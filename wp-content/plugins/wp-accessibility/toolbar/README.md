<h1>a11y (accessibility) toolbar</h1>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Subtle, yet noticeable; easy to use</li>
	<li>Minimally "designed" so that anyone and everyone can and will want to use it on their site, blog, ecommerce, etc.</li>
	<li>Doesn't change existing site layout, but will enhance readability when used</li>
	<li>Semantic; assistive technology and keyboard accessible</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known issues (things in-progress)</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Only Firefox and Webkit browsers can desaturate</li>
	<li><strike>There are tiny shifts in the sizes of the icons when the font size is increased</strike></li>
	<li>Sometimes the styles of a website might take precedence over styles for the toolbar</li>
	<li>The skip link currently looks for a specific ID; I'd like to make it more relative, perhaps by skipping to HTML5's role='main' instead</li>
</ul>

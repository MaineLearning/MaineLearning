= "Sign me up" checkbox =
One of the things NSU does is adding a "Sign me up to your newsletter checkbox" to your comment and registration forms. Most visitors who care to comment are willing to subscribe to your newsletter too.
Signing up to your newsletter is as easy as ticking a checkbox! 

= Sign-up forms =
Another strength of NSU is the ability to create sign-up forms and easily embed those in multiple places. Newsletter Sign-Up comes with a sign-up form widget, a shortcode to use in your posts and/or pages and a function call
to use in your template files. You can even choose to redirect the visitor to a certain page after signing-up, offering them exclusive content or a "thank you for signing up" message.

= Using MailChimp or YMLP? Use their API's! =
If you're using MailChimp or YMLP then you're in luck. Configuring is as easy as providing your API credentials so that Newsletter Sign-Up can work with the API of your newsletter provider.

= Customizable =
All generated forms come with common CSS classes and unique CSS identifiers so that you can easily style them to your likings. 

= Easy to setup =
Configuring Newsletter Sign-Up has been made as easy as possible. With the Configuration Extractor that comes with Newsletter Sign-Up all you have to is provide your sign-up form HTML code, the configuration extractor
tool will then analyze it and try to extract the right values for you.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin adds various way to your WP blog for visitors to subscribe to your third party newsletter service. What once started out as a simple 'Sign me up to your newsletter' checkbox at your comment form is now a 
superb e-mail address gatherer. This plugin respects double opt-in rules, it's all legit.

= What is the shortcode to embed a sign-up form in my posts? =

Its `[newsletter-sign-up-form]`.

= Why does the checkbox not show up? =

You're theme probably does not support the comment hook this plugin uses to add the checkbox to your comment form. You can manually place the checkbox
by calling `<?php if(function_exists('nsu_checkbox')) nsu_checkbox(); ?>` inside the form tags of your comment form. Usually this file can be found in your theme folder as `comments.php`.

= Where can I get the form action of my sign-up form? =

Look at the source code of your sign-up form and check for `<form action="http://www.yourmailinglist.com/signup?a=asd123"`....
The action attribute is what you need here.

= Where can I get the email identifier of my sign-up form? =

Take a look at the source code of your sign-up form and look for the input field that holds the email address. You'll need the NAME attribute of this input field, eg: `<input type="text" name="emailid"....` (in this case emailid is what you need)

= Can I let my users subscribe with their name too? =

Yes, it's possible. Just provide your name identifier (finding it is much like the email identifier) and the plugin will try to submit the user's name along with the request.

= Can I also show a checkbox at the BuddyPress sign-up form? =

Yes.

= Can I show a sign-up form by calling a function in my template files? =

Yes, use the following code snippet in your theme files to embed a sign-up form: `if(function_exists('nsu_signup_form')) nsu_signup_form();`

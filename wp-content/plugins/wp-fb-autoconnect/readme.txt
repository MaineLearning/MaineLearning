A LoginLogout widget with Facebook Connect button, offering hassle-free login for your readers. Clean and extensible.  Supports BuddyPress.


== Description ==

The simple concept behind WP-FB AutoConnect is to offer an easy-to-use widget that lets readers login to your blog with either their Facebook account or local Wordpress credentials. Although many "Facebook Connect" plugins do exist, most of them are either overly complex and difficult to customize, or fail to provide a seamless experience for new  visitors. I wrote this plugin to provide what the others didn't:

* Full support for both Wordpress and Buddypress.
* No user interaction is required - the login process is transparent to new and returning users alike.
* Existing users who connect with FB retain the same local user accounts as before.
* New visitors will be given new user accounts, which can be retained even if you remove the plugin.
* Facebook profile pictures can be used as avatars, even on pre-existing comments.
* User registration announcements can be pushed to Facebook walls.
* No contact with the Facebook API after the login completes - so no slow pageloads.
* Won't bloat your database with duplicate user accounts, extra fields, or unnecessary complications.
* Custom logging options can notify you whenever someone connects with Facebook.
* A powerful set of hooks and filters allow developers to easily tailor the login process to their personal needs: redirect to a custom page, fill xProfile data with information from Facebook, setup permissions based on social connections, and more.
* Fully HTML/CSS valid.


== Installation ==

To allow your users to login with their Facebook accounts, you must first setup an Application for your site:

1. Visit [developers.facebook.com/apps](http://developers.facebook.com/apps) and click the "Create New App" button.
2. Type in a name (i.e. the name of your blog). This is what Facebook will show on the login popup.
3. Facebook may now require you to verify your account before continuing (see [here](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/386/) for more information).
4. Once your app has been created, fill in your "Site URL" under "Select how your app integrates with Facebook -&gt; Website".  Note: http://example.com/ and http://www.example.com/ are *not* the same.
5. Click "Save Changes," and note the App ID and Secret (you'll need them in a minute).

Then you can install the plugin:

1. Download the latest version from [here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-fb-autoconnect/), unzip it, and upload the extracted files to your plugins directory.
2. Login to your Wordpress admin panel and activate the plugin.
3. Navigate to Settings -> WP-FB AutoConn.
4. Enter your App ID and Secret (obtained above), and click "Save."
5. If you're using BuddyPress, a Facebook button will automatically be added to its built-in login panel.  If not, navigate to Appearance -&gt; Widgets and add the WP-FB AutoConnect widget to your sidebar. 

That's it - users should now be able to use the widget to login to your blog with their Facebook accounts.

For more information on exactly how this plugin's login process works and how it can be customized, see the [homepage](http://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect).

== Changelog ==
= 2.3.8 (2012-10-27) =
* Get rid of old nonce debugging code
* Move the nonce check back to before the Facebook connection

= 2.3.7 (2012-10-22) =
* Bug fix when error-detecting the token in the admin panel

= 2.3.6 (2012-10-21) =
* When connecting with Facebook in the admin panel, cache the app token to the database (so addons/customizations can use it to access the API later)

= 2.3.5 (2012-10-20) =
* Add log messages when each action/filter is run in _process_login.php (for debugging add-ins)
* Move the Facebook connection to *before* the nonce check
* Add a new action 'wpfb_session_established,' so we can talk to Facebook before anything else happens 

= 2.3.4 (2012-10-16) =
* Users who didn't update to 2.3.1 when it was released may now have some malformed avatar URLs in their db (resulting in frontend 'strpos' error messages); this update will fix those avatars.  Note:  Please remember to update your plugin whenever a new version is released, as Facebook changes their API regularly and skipping updates can sometimes lead to unpredictable behavior.

= 2.3.3 (2012/08/20) =
* Fixed a problem with Curl detection caused by FB changing things without telling people

= 2.3.2 (2012/08/16) =
* Facebook has yet again broken their API, causing avatars to always fetch size 50x50 (even for the "large" size used by BuddyPress and some 3rd party themes).  This update should work around FB's bug, returning avatars to their former behavior.

= 2.3.1 (2012/07/21) =
* Fix a rare bug with avatar fetching

= 2.3.0 (2012/02/22) =

= 2.2.0 (2011-12-17) =

= 2.1.9 (2011-12-13) =
* Removed an old (now unused) database option that was getting written on every pageload (thanks Aaron Frerichs!)

= 2.1.8 (2011-11-28) =
* Removed plugin sponsorship messages.  See [Automattic Bullies WordPress Plugin Developers -- Again](http://gregsplugins.com/lib/2011/11/26/automattic-bullies/).

= 2.1.5 (2011-11-22) =
* The "Buddypress-Friendly" username format (First.Last) seems to create issues with author links in Wordpress, so I've added a new "First_Last" option (and left the old option there for legacy support only).  If you have multiple authors and are using the "First.Last" format, you may want to change your username format. 

= 2.1.4 (2011-11-16) =

= 1.9.0 (2011-04-01) =
* jfb_output_facebook_callback() is now automatically called by wp_footer; If you're manually outputting your own Facebook buttons, you should now ONLY call jfb_output_facebook_btn() (explicitly calling jfb_output_facebook_callback() is no longer needed!)

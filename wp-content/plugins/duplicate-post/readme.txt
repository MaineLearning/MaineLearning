Clone posts and pages.

== Description ==

This plugin allows to clone a post or page, or edit it as a new draft.

1. In 'Edit Posts'/'Edit Pages', you can click on 'Clone' link below the post/page title: this will immediately create a copy and return to the list.

2. In 'Edit Posts'/'Edit Pages', you can click on 'New Draft' link below the post/page title.

3. On the post edit screen, you can click on 'Copy to a new draft' above "Cancel"/"Move to trash". 

4. While viewing a post as a logged in user, you can click on 'Copy to a new draft' as a dropdown link under "Edit Post" in the admin bar.

2, 3 and 4 will lead to the edit page for the new draft: change what you want, click on 'Publish' and you're done.

**Pay attention to the new behaviour!** The first way now allows you to clone a post with a single click, speeding up your work if you have many posts to duplicate.

There is also a **template tag**, so you can put it in your templates and clone your posts/pages from the front-end. Clicking on the link will lead you to the edit page for the new draft, just like the admin bar link.

In the Options page under Settings it is now possible to choose what to copy:

* the original post/page date
* the original post/page status (draft, published, pending), when cloning from the posts list
* the original post/page excerpt
* the original post/page attachments (actual files won't be copied)
* all the children of the original page
* which taxonomies and custom fields

You can also set a prefix (or a suffix) to place before (or after) the title of the cloned post/page, and the roles allowed to clone posts or pages.

If you want to contribute to translate the plugin in languages other than English, there is a [GlotPress translation project](http://lopo.it/glotpress/projects/duplicate-post) available (no registration required! â€” You can also send me an e-mail using [the form on my website](http://lopo.it/contatti/)).

**If you're a plugin developer**, I suggest to read the section made just for you under "Other Notes", to ensure compatibility between your plugin(s) and mine.

Thanks for all the suggestions, bug reports, translations and donations, they're frankly too many to be listed here!

== Installation ==

Use WordPress' Add New Plugin feature, searching "Duplicate Post", or download the archive and:

1. Unzip the archive on your computer  
2. Upload `duplicate-post` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Go to Settings -> Duplicate Post and customize behaviour as needed

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin doesn't work, why? =

First, check your version of WordPress: the plugin is not supposed to work on old versions anymore. Make sure also to upgrade to the last version of the plugin!

Then try to deactivate and re-activate it, some user have reported that this fixes the problem.

Pay also attention to the new "Roles allowed to copy" option: it should convert the former "user level" option to the new standard, but unknown problems may arise. Make sure that your role is enabled.

If not, maybe there is some kind of conflict with other plugins: feel free [to write me](http://lopo.it/contatti/) and we'll try to discover a solution (it will be *really* helpful if you try to deactivate all your other plugins one by one to see which one conflicts with mine... But do it only if you know what you're doing, I will not be responsible of any problem you may experience).

= Can you add it to the bulk actions in the post/page list? =

I can't. There is no way to do it without hacking the core code of WordPress.
There is an open ticket in WordPress Trac, as other plugin developers too are interested to this feature: we can only hope that eventually our wish will be fulfilled.

== Template tags ==

I have added the template tag `duplicate_post_clone_post_link( $link, $before, $after, $id )`, which behaves just like [edit_post_link()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/edit_post_link).
That means that you can put it in your template (e.g., in single.php or page.php) so you can get a "Clone" link when displaying a post or page.

The parameters are:

* *link*
    (string) (optional) The link text. Default: __('Clone','duplicate-post') 

* *before*
    (string) (optional) Text to put before the link text. Default: None 

* *after*
    (string) (optional) Text to put after the link text. Default: None 

* *id*
    (integer) (optional) Post ID. Default: Current post ID
    
Another available template tag is `duplicate_post_get_original($id, $output)` which returns the original post, either as a post object, an associative array or a numeric array (depending on the $output parameter), jus as [get_post()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post) does.
`duplicate_post_get_original()` relies on the `_dp_original` custom field.


== For plugin developers ==

From version 1.0 onwards, thanks to [Simon Wheatley](http://www.simonwheatley.co.uk/)'s suggestion, Duplicate Post adds two actions (*dp_duplicate_post* and *dp_duplicate_page*) which can be used by other developers if their plugins store extra data for posts in non-standard WP tables.
Since Duplicate Post knows only of standard WP tables, it can't copy other data relevant to the post which is being copied if this information is stored elsewhere. So, if you're a plugin developer which acts this way, and you want to ensure compatibility with Duplicate Post, you can hook your functions to those actions to make sure that they will be called when a post (or page) is cloned.

It's very simple. Just write your function that copies post metadata to a new row of your table:
`function myplugin_copy_post($new_post_id, $old_post_object){
/* your code */
}`

Then hook the function to the action:
`add_action( "dp_duplicate_post", "myplugin_copy_post", $priority, 2);`

dp_duplicate_page is used for pages and hierarchical custom post types; for every other type of posts, dp_duplicate_post is used.

Please refer to the [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API) for every information about the subject.

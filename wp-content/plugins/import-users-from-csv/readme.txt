Import users from a CSV file into WordPress

== Description ==

I needed to batch import users into WordPress but I didn't find any plugin which would import all the user data fields as well as user meta.

This plugin allows you to import users from an uploaded CSV file. It will add users with basic information as well as meta fields and user role.

You can also choose to send a notification to the new users and to display password nag on user login.

[Check out my other free plugins.](http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/sorich87/)

= Features =

* Imports all users fields
* Imports user meta
* Update existing users by specifying ID field
* Allows setting user role
* Sends new user notification (if the option is selected)
* Shows password nag on user login (if the option is selected)

Or use a nifty tool by WordPress lead developer Mark Jaquith:

For a manual installation via FTP:

1. Upload the `import-users-from-csv` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in your WordPress admin area
1. Upload your CSV file in the 'Users' menu, under 'Import From CSV'


To upload the plugin through WordPress, instead of FTP:

1. Upload the downloaded zip file on the 'Add New' plugins screen (see the 'Upload' tab) in your WordPress admin area and activate.
1. Upload your CSV file in the 'Users' menu, under 'Import From CSV'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use? =

Click on the 'Import From CSV' link in the 'Users' menu, choose your CSV file, choose if you want to send a notification email to new users and if you want the password nag to be displayed when they login, then click 'Import'.

Each row in your CSV file should represent a user; each column identifies user data or meta data.
If a column name matches a field in the user table, data from this column is imported in that field; if not, data is imported in a user meta field with the name of the column.

Look at the example.csv file in the plugin directory to have a better understanding of how the your CSV file should be organized.
You can try importing that file and look at the result.

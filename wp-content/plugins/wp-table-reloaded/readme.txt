== Description ==

> #### Attention: WP-Table Reloaded is being replaced with TablePress!

> For users of WP-Table Reloaded, no immediate action is necessary, but it is recommended that you [migrate](http://tablepress.org/migration-from-wp-table-reloaded/) to TablePress soon.

WP-Table Reloaded enables you to create and manage tables in your WP's admin area. No HTML knowledge is needed. A comfortable backend allows to easily edit table data. Tables can contain any type of data and additional JavaScript libraries can be used to extend it with features like sorting, pagination, filtering, and more. You can include the tables into your posts, on your pages or in text widgets by using a shortcode or a template tag function. Tables can be imported and exported from/to CSV, XML and HTML.

The easiest way is through your WordPress Admin area. Go to the plugin section and search for "WP-Table Reloaded" in the WordPress Plugin Directory. Then you can click "Install" and the following steps will be done for you automatically. You just have to activate the plugin (step 5).

Manual Installation works just as for most other WordPress plugins:

1. Download and Extract the zip file and just drop the folder "wp-table-reloaded" into the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.

1. Activate the Plugin "WP-Table Reloaded" on your "Plugins" page.

1. Create and manage tables via "WP-Table Reloaded" in the "Tools" section.

1. Include a table by adding the shortcode [table id=&lt;your-table's-id&gt; /] to your post, page or text widget.

1. You might want to add styling features via the option in the "Plugin Options" screen, where you can enter your CSS directly.

= Where can I find answers to Frequently Asked Questions? =

A wide group of questions, regarding different features or styling has been answered in the [FAQ section](http://tobias.baethge.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-table-reloaded-english/faq/) on the plugin's website.

= Can I use wp-Table and WP-Table Reloaded together? =

Yes! You can have both wp-Table and WP-Table Reloaded installed in your WordPress! They will not interfere (as they are not using anything together). They are completely independent from each other.
If WP-Table Reloaded finds the wp-Table database tables, it can import the found tables into it's own format, so that you can completely upgrade from wp-Table to WP-Table Reloaded.

= Support? =

For support questions, bug reports, or feature requests, please use the [WordPress Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-table-reloaded). Please [search](http://wordpress.org/support/) through the forums first, and then only [open a new thread](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-table-reloaded) if you don't find an existing answer. Thank you!

= Requirements? =

In short: WordPress 3.1 or higher, the latest version of WordPress is recommended.

= Languages and Localization? =

The plugin currently includes the following languages:
Arabic, Belarusian, Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Chinese (Simplified), Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian.

I'd really appreciate it, if you would translate the plugin into your language! Using Heiko Rabe's WordPress plugin [Codestyling Localization](http://www.code-styling.de/english/development/wordpress-plugin-codestyling-localization-en/) that really is as easy as pie. Just install the plugin, add your language, create the .po-file, translate the strings in the comfortable editor and create the .mo-file. It will automatically be saved in WP-Table Reloaded's plugin folder. If you send me the .mo- and .po-file, I will gladly include them into future plugin releases.
There is also a .pot-file available to use in the "languages" subfolder. Of course you can also use poEdit as your editor, which also works nicely.

= Where can I get more information? =

== Usage ==

> #### Attention: WP-Table Reloaded is being replaced with TablePress!
> If you are starting a new project, please do not use WP-Table Reloaded anymore! Instead, please use the [TablePress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tablepress/) plugin, which is the official and designated successor of WP-Table Reloaded.
> For users of WP-Table Reloaded, no immediate action is necessary, but it is recommended that you [migrate](http://tablepress.org/migration-from-wp-table-reloaded/) to TablePress soon.

After installing the plugin, you can add, import, export, edit, copy, delete, ... tables via the "WP-Table Reloaded" screen which appears under the "Tools" section in your Admin menu.
Everything should be self-explaining there.

To show one of your tables in a post, on a page or in a text widget, just include the shortcode [table id=&lt;the-id&gt; /] to your post/page/text-widget, where &lt;the-id&gt is the ID of your table (can be found on the left side of the "List tables" screen.)

After that you might want to change the style of the table. You can do this by entering CSS commands into the "Custom CSS" textarea on the "Plugin Options" screen.
You may also add certain features (like sorting, pagination, filtering, alternating row colors, row highlighting, print name and/or description, ...) by checking the appropriate options on the "Edit table" screen.

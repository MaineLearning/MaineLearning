Very simple plugin for reliably inserting your Google Analytics tracking code on every page.

== Description ==

This is a bare bones option for people who are looking to simply insert the basic Google Analytics tracking code into the head section of every page. 

I've only included the essential options; it's not very exciting, but works *reliably*.

== Installation ==

1. Download the latest zip file and extract the `super-simple-google-analytics` directory.
2. Upload the this directory inside your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate 'Super Simple Google Analytics' on the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Click 'Settings' underneath the plugin or navigate to Settings > Google Analytics and insert your GA tracking code and click the checkbox to turn it on.
5. That's it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you add this feature I just thought of? =

Possibly, I'm trying to keep this as simple as possible, but if it's a really useful/uncomplicated feature that I've omitted I will definitely consider it.

== Screenshots ==

1. The bare bones options page.
2. Where to find your Google Analytics account number.
3. Source of the tracking code inserted just before &lt;/body&gt;.

* First release

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Do I need to do anything else for AP Extended MIME Types to work? =
Nope, just upload and activate. There are not options, so the code'll do the rest.

= How do I add a new MIME type? =
Edit *mime-types.txt* to add/remove MIME types. Add your new MIME type in this format: *extension content/type*. For example:

* pdf application/pdf
* mid,midi audio/midi

For more file and formatting examples, view the *mime-types.txt* file. Also, a full list of MIME types is kept up on the [IANA](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority") website.

= What in the world is a MIME? =
No, MIMEs are not white-faced, beret-sporting people who live in a *"box"*. MIMEs are [Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type).

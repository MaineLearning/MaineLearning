A simple way to change a post's type in WordPress

== Description ==

Any combination is possible, even custom post types:

* Page to Post
* Post to Page
* Page to Attachment
* Post to Custom

Note: Invisible post types (revisions, menus, etc...) are purposely excluded. Filter 'pts_post_type_filter' to adjust the boundaries.

Now with bulk editing, thanks to Matthew Gerring!

You need to selectively change a posts type from one to another.

= Does this ruin my taxonomy associations? =
It should not. This plugin only changes the 'post_type' property of a post.

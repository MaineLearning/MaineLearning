== Frequently Asked Questions ==  

= I can not see the admin menu =

Do not activate the plugin sitewide.

It only support giving points for joining public groups at the moment.

= Members not getting awards or points for group avatar update for hidden groups =

It only tracks public and private groups.

= Member not getting points for Group Avatar Upload =

After the group is created go to the admin of the created group and go to the group avatar page to get points.

= Did you create CubePoints? =

No I did not create CubePoints, this is just an extension of it. Jonathan Lau and Peter Zhang created it.

= Can I change the point values? =

Yes, just update the point values in the BP CubePoints admin menu. To remove points enter a negative number.

= When I create a Group Forum Topic it gives them points twice. =

BuddyPress calls 2 functions when creating a forum topic. So think of how much you want to give them total for creating a new topic and adjust the points accordingly in the BP CubePoints admin menu.

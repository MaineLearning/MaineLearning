WordPress Website Security Protection. Website security protection against: XSS, RFI, CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking... 

== Description ==

WordPress Website Security Protection: BulletProof Security protects your WordPress website against XSS, RFI, CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts. One-click .htaccess WordPress security protection. Protects wp-config.php, bb-config.php, php.ini, php5.ini, install.php and readme.html with .htaccess security protection. One-click Website Maintenance Mode (HTTP 503). Additional website security checks: DB errors off, file and folder permissions check... System Info: PHP, MySQL, OS, Server, Memory Usage, IP, SAPI, DNS, Max Upload... Built-in .htaccess file editing, uploading and downloading.

The BulletProof Security WordPress Security plugin is designed to be a fast, simple and one click security plugin to 
add .htaccess website security protection for your WordPress website. Activate .htaccess website security and .htaccess
 website under maintenance modes from within your WordPress Dashboard - no FTP required. The BulletProof Security 
 WordPress plugin is a one click security solution that creates, copies, renames, moves or writes to the provided 
 BulletProof Security .htaccess master files. BulletProof Security protects both your Root website folder and wp-admin 
 folder with .htaccess website security protection, as well as providing additional website security protection.

BulletProof Security allows you to add .htaccess website security protection from within the WordPress Dashboard so 
that you do not have to access your website via FTP or your Web Host Control Panel in order to add website security 
protection for your WordPress site. BulletProof Security Modes: Root .htaccess security protection, wp-admin .htaccess
 security protection, Deny All .htaccess self protection, WordPress default .htaccess mode and .htaccess Maintenance 
 Mode (503 Website Under Maintenance). In BulletProof Security Mode your WordPress website is protected from XSS, RFI,
 CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts.

BPS Maintenance Mode allows you to create your custom website under maintenance page within BulletProof Security 
and activate Maintenance Mode to put your website in maintenance mode. Maintenance Mode allows website developers or
website owners to access and work on a website while a 503 Website Under Maintenance page is displayed to
all other visitors to the website. Allow access to your WordPress Dashboard for only yourself or add additional IP 
addresses to allow mulitple IP addresses access to your WP Dashboard while in maintenance mode.

WordPress is already very secure, but every website, no matter what type of platform it is built on should
be using a secure .htaccess file as a standard website security measure. BulletProof Security provides the additional website
 security measures and protection that every website should have.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the BulletProof Security Plugin work? =

The BulletProof Security Plugin allows you to instantly create and activate .htaccess website security with 
one click (ok maybe a few clicks) for your website without having to know anything about .htaccess files. The Master 
.htaccess files are pre-made and BPS writes .htaccess code specific to your website. There is nothing to figure out 
or to configure. Click the AutoMagic buttons and Activate BulletProof Modes. BPS has built-in Backup and Restore and 
an .htaccess File Editor for full manual editing control as well. Website security fast and simple. Enjoy!

= Are there any known conflicts with other WordPress Plugins or Themes? =

Yep here and there issues do pop up with plugins, but they are always quickly resolved in minutes.
Please check the BulletProof Security <a href="http://www.ait-pro.com/aitpro-blog/2252/bulletproof-security-plugin-support/checking-plugin-compatibility-with-bps-plugin-testing-to-do-list/" title="BPS Plugin Testing and Fixes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Plugin Compatibility Testing and Fixes</a> page
 for any new fixes that are not yet included in the most current version of BPS. Typically a simple .htaccess skip rule is all 
 that is required to fix any plugin conflict issues.

= What is the difference between BulletProof Security free and BulletProof Security Pro? =

BulletProof Security free provides .htaccess protection against browser based hacking attempts: XSS, RFI, CRLF, CSRF, Base64, 
Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts. It is recommended that you additionally add a secure custom php.ini, log 
PHP errors, lock ALL WordPress Mission Critical files and add HTTP error logging for your website. BulletProof Security Pro 
contains the same secure .htaccess files as the free version and includes secure custom php.ini files, logs PHP errors, locks 
ALL WordPress Mission Critical files on the fly and has built-in HTTP error logging to log 400, 403 and 404 errors that occur 
on your website. BPS Pro 5.1.5 has the first generation of AutoRestore Countermeasure security for automatic file restoring.

= Is BulletProof Security automatically setup already? =

Yes and No. You must be using a WordPress Custom Permalink structure for BPS to work correctly (every WordPress site should be anyway).
 If you are not using a custom Permalink structure then you will get a warning message that Custom Permalinks need to be enabled when you
 access the BulletProof Security Options page. BulletProof Security includes AutoMagic Master .htaccess file creation so that only one 
 click is required to automatically create your Master .htaccess security files for your website, which you then Activate - BulletProof Mode. 
 BulletProof Security also offers full manual control of editing the .htaccess files using the built-in File Editor. BulletProof Security 
 is designed with everyone in mind: regular folks, Designers, Developers and Coders. BulletProof Security is designed to work with every 
 type of WordPress installation: Single websites, subfolder websites, subdomain websites, "Giving WordPress its Own Directory" websites, 
 Network / MU subdirectory websites and Network / MU subdomain websites. BulletProof Security will automatically create the correct Master 
 .htaccess files for your website when you click the AutoMagic buttons. If you prefer to do everything manually then you would edit your 
 .htaccess using the built-in .htaccess File Editor instead of using Automagic to automatically create your .htaccess files.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof Security .htaccess files? =

Yes. Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess Master .htaccess files already contain 
 .htaccess security code that protects your website against XSS, RFI, CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts. 
 Add any additional security filters or other .htaccess code to your Master .htaccess files or your currently active .htaccess files using 
 the built-in .htaccess File Editor. The BulletProof Security Master .htaccess files contain help info and additional options within the 
 the .htaccess files themselves. htaccess files can do a lot of neat things besides just providing website security protection. As of 
 version .46.9 you can now also add any custom code to the Custom Code feature. Your custom .htaccess code will be saved to your WP DB
 permanently until you delete it. Please view the Read Me Help button in Custom Code for specific details.

= Does the BulletProof Security Plugin create or write the .htaccess files? =

Yes. BulletProof Security has full AutoMagic capability and automatically creates the .htaccess files for your webiste. BulletProof
Security also offers full manual control of editing both the BPS Master .htaccess files and your currently active .htaccess files using 
the built-in .htaccess File Editor. The BPS Master .htaccess files have already been pre-made. When you click the AutoMagic buttons your 
.htaccess Master files are created with specific code for your specific website with the correct RewriteRule and RewriteBase automatically added 
to your .htaccess files. You can add additional code to the master .htaccess files, edit the .htaccess files or create completely new .htaccess 
master files from within the WordPress Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor - no FTP required - no Web Host Control Panel required. 
 BPS could also just be used simply as an online .htaccess file editor and manager. AutoMagic is great, but having both AutoMagic and full manual
  editing control makes BulletProof Security a very versatile website security protection tool.
  
= Does BulletProof Security Work on Windows IIS Hosting? =

Yes and No. .htaccess files are only used on Linux based hosting. You can install BulletProof Security if you have a Windows IIS
hosted website to use the additional features in BPS, but you cannot Activate BulletProof Modes or use .htaccess files on Windows Hosting. 
At some point in the future additional coding will be added just for Windows IIS websites.

= Is BulletProof Security Network / MU / Multisite Compatible? =

Yes. BulletProof Security contains AutoMagic buttons for Network /  MU / Multisite websites. Both sub-directory and sub-domain Master .htaccess 
code is written / created for your specific Network / MU site. BulletProof Modes should only be Activated on the Primary site. All sub sites 
are virtual and there is no need to Activate BulletProof Modes on sub sites. This will actually screw up your Primary site. BPS allows only 
Super Admins to see the BPS menus in sub sites.

= Is BulletProof Security Compatible with subdomain websites and subdirectory websites? =

Yes. BulletProof Security works on all types of WordPress installations including "Giving WordPress Its Own Directory" websites.

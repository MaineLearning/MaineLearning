System Info: PHP, MySQL, OS, Server, Memory Usage, IP, SAPI, DNS, Max Upload... Built-in .htaccess file editing, uploading and downloading.

= Why is .htaccess Website Security So Much Better Than Any Other Type of Website Security? =

The answer is very simple - .htaccess files (distributed configuration files) are processed first before any other code on your website. In other words, 
hackers malicious scripts are stopped by BulletProof Security .htaccess files before those scripts even have a chance to 
reach the php coding in WordPress. BulletProof Security uses .htaccess website security files, which are specific to 
Apache Linux Servers. Please read the FAQ page for Server compatibility questions. 

= BulletProof Security Fast and Simple with No Manual Configuration Required =

The BulletProof Security WordPress Security plugin is designed to be a fast, simple and one click security plugin to 
add .htaccess website security protection for your WordPress website. Activate .htaccess website security and .htaccess 
website under maintenance modes from within your WordPress Dashboard - no FTP required. The BulletProof Security 
WordPress plugin is a one click security solution that creates, copies, renames, moves or writes to the provided 
BulletProof Security .htaccess master files. BulletProof Security protects both your Root website folder and wp-admin 
folder with .htaccess website security protection, as well as providing additional website security protection.

BulletProof Security allows you to add .htaccess website security protection from within the WordPress Dashboard so 
that you do not have to access your website via FTP or your Web Host Control Panel in order to add website security 
protection for your WordPress site. BulletProof Security Modes: Root .htaccess security protection, wp-admin .htaccess 
security protection, Deny All .htaccess self protection, WordPress default .htaccess mode and .htaccess Maintenance 
Mode (503 Website Under Maintenance). In BulletProof Security Mode your WordPress website is protected from XSS, RFI, 
CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts.

= BulletProof Security Maintenance Mode =

BulletProof Security Maintenance Mode allows you to create your custom website under maintenance page within BulletProof Security 
and activate Maintenance Mode to put your website in maintenance mode. Maintenance Mode allows website developers or
website owners to access and work on a website while a 503 Website Under Maintenance page is displayed to
all other visitors to the website. Allow access to your WordPress Dashboard for only yourself or add additional IP 
addresses to allow mulitple IP addresses access to your WP Dashboard while in maintenance mode.

= BulletProof Security Additional Website Security Protection =

WordPress is already very secure, but every website, no matter what type of platform it is built on should
have additional website security measures in place as a standard. BulletProof Security provides that additional website
 security protection that every website should have.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the BulletProof Security Plugin work? =

The BulletProof Security Plugin allows you to instantly create and activate .htaccess website security with 
one click (ok maybe a few clicks) for your website without having to know anything about .htaccess files. The Master 
.htaccess files are pre-made and BPS writes .htaccess code that is customized for your website. There is nothing to figure out 
or to configure. Click the AutoMagic buttons (creates customized Master .htaccess files) and Activate BulletProof Modes (copies 
the customized Master .htaccess files to your root and wp-admin folders). BPS has built-in Backup and Restore and 
an .htaccess File Editor for full manual editing control as well. BulletProof Website Security fast and simple. Enjoy!

= Do I need to understand .htaccess code in order to use the BulletProof Security Plugin? =

No, The .htaccess file creation is automated in BulletProof Security. Everything is automatically done for you.
You do not need to know or understand anything about .htaccess website security files in order to use the 
BulletProof Security plugin.

= What do I do if I cannot log back into my website? =

If you accidentally activated BulletProof Modes without first clicking the AutoMagic buttons or if you put your 
website in Maintenance Mode and your IP address has been changed by your ISP and you cannot log back into 
your website then you will need to use FTP or your Web Host Control Panel File Manager and delete the .htaccess file 
that BPS created in your website root folder. BPS website security is done purely with .htaccess website security
and nothing else is modified on your website. So simply deleting the .htaccess file in your website root folder
removes BPS website security and will allow you to log back in, use the AutoMagic buttons and activate 
BulletProof Mode again to protect your website again.

= Will BulletProof Security cause my website to run slower? =

No, BulletProof Security will not cause a website to run slower. BulletProof Security is website performance optimized 
and uses very little/low website resources and very little Server memory. If you would like to check your plugins to check 
how much website resource and Server memory each of your plugins is using install the P3 (Plugin Performance Profiler) plugin.

= When I upgraded/updated BulletProof Security I saw an Alert. What does the Alert mean? =

When upgrading/updating the BulletProof Security plugin you will see this WP Dashboard Alert. <strong>BPS Alert! Your site does not 
appear to be protected by BulletProof Security.</strong> As of BulletProof Security .47.2 WP Dashboard Alerts have been added to check 
your Root and wp-admin .htaccess files to ensure that your website is protected. During the upgrade your .htaccess files will 
be automatically updated and any new .htaccess security filters will be automatically added to your .htaccess files. In order 
for BPS to automatically update your htaccess files you will need to stay current with BPS plugin updates and install the latest BPS 
plugin updates when they are available. Any custom htaccess code or modifications that you have made to your htaccess files will not 
be altered, modified or changed. Activating BulletProof Modes again after upgrading BPS is no longer necessary.

= Where can I find BulletProof Security troubleshooting steps & support? =

Please see the <a href="http://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/forum/bulletproof-security-free/" title="BulletProof Security Forum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BulletProof Security Forum.</a>

= Does BulletProof Security work on every type of Server? =

BulletProof Security uses .htaccess website security files, which are specific to Apache Linux Servers. BPS is compatible with Apache Linux Servers
 and Nginx Servers - if the Nginx Server is on the frontend and an Apache Linux Server is on the backend). If you do not know what type of Server 
 you have you can check your Server Type and Operating System on the BPS System Info page.

= Does BulletProof Security Work on Windows IIS Servers? =

Yes and No. .htaccess files are only used on Linux based hosting. You can install BulletProof Security if you have a Windows IIS
hosted website to use the additional features in BPS, but you cannot Activate BulletProof Modes and use .htaccess files on Windows Hosting.
Please see this WordPress Codex <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Permalinks_without_mod_rewrite" title="Permalinks without mod_rewrite" target="_blank">Permalinks without mod_rewrite</a> for more information.

= Does BulletProof Security Work on Nginx Servers? =

If you are using both Apache and Nginx together and Nginx is the frontend webserver and Apache is the backend Server
used to process PHP then BulletProof Security will work on this type of combined Server Configuration. If you are only
using Nginx then an .htaccess file will not work. Nginx has its own rewrite module - HttpRewriteModule and the mod_rewrite equivalent
of an .htaccess file has similar, but different coding and is added to an Nginx Server config file.
Note: If you are not familiar with Nginx, then it should be noted that Nginx does not have a PHP module like apache’s mod_php, 
instead you either need to build PHP with FPM (ie: php-fpm/fastcgi), or you need to pass the request to something that can handle PHP.

= Are there any known issues or conflicts with other WordPress Plugins or Themes? =

Occaisonally issues or conflicts do occur with other plugins, but they are always quickly resolved. BPS is compatible with all
other Plugins and Themes. An .htaccess bypass / skip rule is all that is required to allow a plugin to do something that is blocked by BPS.
Please check the BulletProof Security <a href="http://www.ait-pro.com/aitpro-blog/2252/bulletproof-security-plugin-support/checking-plugin-compatibility-with-bps-plugin-testing-to-do-list/" title="BPS Plugin Testing and Fixes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Plugin Compatibility Testing and Fixes</a> page for the latest plugin bypass / skip rules.

= I am seeing Security Log entries in my BulletProof Security Log. What do they mean? =

Your Security Log will log 400, 403 and 404 (requires copying the 404 logging code to your Theme\'s 404.php Template) Errors. 
The Security Log logs 400 and 403 HTTP Response Status Codes by default. You can also log 404 HTTP Response Status Codes by opening this BPS 
404 Template file - /bulletproof-security/404.php and copying the logging code into your Theme's 404 Template file. When you open the BPS Pro 
404.php file you will see simple instructions on how to add the 404 logging code to your Theme's 404 Template file.

HTTP Response Status Codes
400 Bad Request - The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.

403 Forbidden - The Server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.

404 Not Found - The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI / URL. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent.

= Is BulletProof Security Network / MU / Multisite Compatible? =

Yes. BulletProof Security contains AutoMagic buttons for Network / MU / Multisite websites. Both sub-directory and sub-domain Master .htaccess 
code is written / created for your specific Network / MU site. BulletProof Modes should only be Activated on the Primary site. All sub sites 
are virtual and there is no need to Activate BulletProof Modes on sub sites. This will actually screw up your Primary site. BPS allows only 
Super Admins to see the BPS menus in sub sites. BPS also works with Network / MU Domain Mapping.

= Is BulletProof Security Compatible with subdomain websites and subdirectory websites? =

Yes, BulletProof Security works on all types of WordPress installations including "Giving WordPress Its Own Directory" websites.

= Is BulletProof Security automatically setup already? =

Yes and No. You must be using a WordPress Custom Permalink structure for BPS to work correctly (every WordPress site should be anyway). If 
you are not using a custom Permalink structure then you will get a warning message that Custom Permalinks need to be enabled when you access 
the BulletProof Security Options page. BulletProof Security includes AutoMagic Master .htaccess file creation so that only one click is 
required to automatically create your Master .htaccess security files for your website, which you then Activate - BulletProof Mode. 
BulletProof Security also offers full manual control of editing the .htaccess files using the built-in File Editor. BulletProof Security is 
designed with everyone in mind: regular folks, Designers, Developers and Coders. BulletProof Security is designed to work with every type 
of WordPress installation: Single websites, subfolder websites, subdomain websites, "Giving WordPress its Own Directory" websites, 
Network / MU subdirectory websites and Network / MU subdomain websites. BulletProof Security will automatically create the correct Master 
.htaccess files for your website when you click the AutoMagic buttons. If you prefer to do everything manually then you would edit your 
.htaccess using the built-in .htaccess File Editor instead of using Automagic to automatically create your .htaccess files.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof Security .htaccess files? =

Yes. Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess Master .htaccess files already contain .htaccess security code that protects 
your website against XSS, RFI, CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts. Add any additional security filters or 
other .htaccess code to your Master .htaccess files or your currently active .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. The 
BulletProof Security Master .htaccess files contain help info and additional options within the .htaccess files themselves. htaccess files 
can do a lot of neat things besides just providing website security protection. As of version .46.9 you can now also add any custom code 
to the Custom Code feature. Your custom .htaccess code will be saved to your WP DB permanently until you delete it. Please view the Read Me 
Help button in Custom Code for specific details.

= Does the BulletProof Security Plugin create or write the .htaccess files? =

Yes, BulletProof Security creates customized .htaccess website security files with AutoMagic. BulletProof Security also offers full manual 
control of editing both the BPS Master .htaccess files and your currently active .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. 
The BPS Master .htaccess files have already been pre-made. When you click the AutoMagic buttons your .htaccess Master files are created with 
specific code for your specific website with the correct RewriteRule and RewriteBase automatically added to your .htaccess files. You can 
add additional code to the master .htaccess files, edit the .htaccess files or create completely new .htaccess master files from within the 
WordPress Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor - no FTP required - no Web Host Control Panel required.  BPS could also just be used 
simply as an online .htaccess file editor and manager. AutoMagic is great, but having both AutoMagic and full manual editing control makes 
BulletProof Security a very versatile website security protection tool.

= Does BulletProof Security work with Git distributed version control system? =

Yes, BulletProof Security works with Git, but does require some additional set up steps. Please see this thread for the setup steps
 <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-bulletproof-security-bps-and-folder-locations?replies=15#post-2979555" title="BPS Plugin Language Translation Tutorial" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Git distributed version control system setup steps</a>

What's New in .47.8

= .47.8 =

* Security Logging / HTTP Error Logging - Log 400, 403 and 404 Errors:
Your Security Log file is a plain text static file and not a dynamic file or dynamic display to keep your website resource usage at a 
bare minimum and keep your website performance at a maximum.
 	 
* Security Logging / HTTP Error Logging Dashboard Alert:
When your log file gets larger than 500KB you will see a WP Dashboard Alert displayed. Copy and paste the Security Log file contents 
into a Notepad text file on your computer and save it. Then click the Delete Log button to delete the contents of this Log file.
 	 
* NEW root .htacess file code automatically created/modified on upgrade:
The new ErrorDocument Error log htaccess code is automatically added to your Root .htaccess file when you upgrade to .47.8. 
The FORBID EMPTY REFFERER SPAMBOTS .htaccess code is automatically deleted from your Root .htaccess file. This code has been problematic 
on a number of websites and this htaccess code is not really effective against blocking empty referrer spambots anymore.
 	 
* Additional System Info Check Added: cURL Extension:
You will see an additional System Information check on the System Info tab page that checks whether or not the cURL Extension is loaded on your website.
 	 
* Coding Improvements & Enhancements:
Of course, but why not mention it anyway.

* Enjoy!

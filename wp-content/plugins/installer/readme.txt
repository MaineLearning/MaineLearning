== Description ==

Need help buying, installing and upgrading commercial themes and plugins? **Installer** handles all this for you, right from the WordPress admin.

Installer lets you find themes and plugins from different sources, then, buy them from within the WordPress admin. Instead of manually uploading and unpacking, you'll see those themes and plugins available, just like any other plugin you're getting from WordPress.org.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'Installer' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

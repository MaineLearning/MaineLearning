== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My database is not backed up / My backup file is 0Kb =
* Ensure that your host allows you to access mysqldump. You can try to narrow the problem by [Debugging via SSH](http://forums.lesterchan.net/index.php/topic,4549.0.html "Debugging via SSH").

= What is the difference between WP-DBManager and WP-DB-Backup? =
* WP-DBManager uses `mysqldump` application to generate the backup and `mysql` application to restore them via shell.
* WP-DB-Backup uses PHP to generate the backup. In some cases WP-DB-Backup will work better for you because it requires less permissions. Not all host allows you to access mysqldump/mysql directly via shell.
* WP-DBManager allows you to have automatic optimizing and repairing of database on top of backing up of database.

= Why do I get the message "Warning: Your backup folder MIGHT be visible to the public!"? =
* Ensure that you have renamed `htaccess.txt` to `.htaccess` and placed it in your backup folder (defaults to `wp-content/backup-db/`)
* If you are 100% sure you have did that and have verfied that the folder no longer is accessible to the public by visiting the URL `http://yousite.com/wp-content/backup-db/`, you can safely remove it by deleting `add_action('admin_notices', 'dbmanager_admin_notices');` on `line 191` in `wp-dbmanager.php`.

BuddyPress Links is a drop-in link, image, video and other rich media sharing component for BuddyPress 1.5 and 1.6

== Description ==

#### Overview

If you're running a BuddyPress community, and would like to give your members the ability to
easily share content from across the web, this is your solution! BuddyPress Links allows your
members to quickly and easily share links, images, videos, and other rich content.

All links that are shared by your community (with privacy mode set to public) are displayed
in a central directory where your members can filter, vote, and comment on them.

> *If you are anxious to try it out, go to the fully functional demo at http://demo.presscrew.com/*

Links is fully integrated with these BuddyPress core components:

> *Profiles, Activity Stream, Widgets, Notifications, Admin Bar, Admin Dashboard*

This deep integration adds a powerful new social tool through which your members can interact:

* Your members can see the links they've submitted on their own profile, as well as other's.
* Privacy settings allow your members to have total control over who sees which links.
* A new activity stream tab is added so your members can quickly see new links which have been added by friends or by other members from across the site.
* Your members can comment and vote on each other's links.
* A powerful ranking algorithm turns your links directory into a social book-marking destination.

We've seen some amazing examples of BuddyPress Links in action. Use it to create a directory of images or videos (with built-in lightbox support) for your members to vote upon. Or use it to build a tutorial section of your community with links pointing to articles or rich media from across the web. BuddyPress Links is flexible enough to handle it all.

#### Feature List

Members can:

* Create and manage links from their profile
* Assign links to a category
* Control the visibility of their links (public, friends only, and hidden)

* Automatic thumbnail picker available as of 0.2.1

== Screenshots ==

1. Links behaves just like a root component, complete with its own directory for links which have their privacy set to public.
2. Links for embedded videos and images play in a modal window at their original size.
3. Links is fully integrated into the activity stream, including several powerful filters for limiting results.
4. When creating a link, rich media and thumbnails are auto-detected. Quickly select a thumbnail to display for the link.
5. Edit fetched link content to clean up title and description, or to completely customize the content to your liking.
6. You can choose to use the fetched thumbnail, or to upload a custom image from your computer.
7. Each link has its own privacy setting for full control over who sees your links.
8. Uploading a custom link image (avatar) is identical to other root components.
9. Links is fully integrated into member profiles. View link related activity for yourself or another member. Conveniently create a new link directly from your profile.
10. Links activity is integrated into the profile, just like the core components.
11. A BuddyPress compatible link list widget is available to add to any sidebar. Advanced filtering and sorting is possible directly in the widget.
12. Links completely integrates with the groups component (pro version only). Group members can add links to the group. All group link activity is visible from the groupâ€™s activity page. Group administrators have full control over which links are allowed.
13. Easily share an existing link with your profile or any group you are a member of (pro version only). Use this powerful feature to track external resources for yourself, or inside of a group.
14. Links has a complete set of administration tools available in the WordPress dashboard.
15. Manage all links from a central location.
16. Manage available link categories.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the license? =

Released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 3.0 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt)

All original code is Copyright (c) 2009 Marshall Sorenson. All rights reserved.

= How do I customize the default templates? =

To override only certain templates from the bp-links-default theme directory,
create a directory named "bp-links-default" in your child theme,
and replace the template using the EXACT same path AND filename.

To create a totally custom theme in order to completely bypass any core links
themes you will need to define a custom theme name.

For example, if your active WordPress theme is 'bluesky', and you wanted
to define your links theme as 'links-custom', you would put your files in:

/path/to/wp-content/themes/bluesky/links-custom

And in wp-config.php you would place this define statement:

define( 'BP_LINKS_CUSTOM_THEME', 'links-custom' )

To find out which template files are required to exist, do a recursive search for 'bp_links_load_template'
